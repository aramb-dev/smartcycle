# Module 3 – Troubleshooting Report

## Scenario
SmartCycle is no longer recieving sensor data from their components.

## Step 1: Identify the Problem

- When users report issues, the SmartCycle support team cannot see sensor logs in the monitoring application.
- The system log file has not been updated or written to for an extended period of time.

## Step 2: Form Possible Causes

Several potential causes could explain why SmartCycle is no longer receiving sensor data:

- One or more sensors may be damaged, disconnected, or powered off.
- Sensors may be unable to transmit data due to a broken wired connection or wireless communication issue.
- A recent update or bug may have caused the data collection service to stop running.
- The service responsible for writing sensor data to log files may be stopped or misconfigured.
- Insufficient power or battery problems may prevent sensors from operating correctly.
