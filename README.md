# Capstone Project Overview

This repository contains all six modules for the SmartCycle Capstone Project.
Each module has its own folder with planning notes, explanations, and implementation files.
The root README provides an overview of what each module requires and how the work is structured.

# Module 1 — Arrays, Data Operations, ASCII Visualization

### Goal

Create two weekly datasets, perform array operations, compute totals/averages, and produce an ASCII graph.

### What to complete

* Plan datasets (battery outputs + distances for 7 days)
* Describe planned operations: insert, update, pop, search, slice, concatenate
* Explain math for totals and averages
* Design ASCII graph format
* Implement operations in Python and commit the script to `module1_arrays/`

### Deliverables

* `arrays_plan.md`
* `arrays.py`
* Module README


# Module 2 — Choosing Appropriate Data Structures

### Goal

Demonstrate understanding of dictionaries, sets, and lists as they apply to SmartCycle data.

### What to complete

* Design:

  * Dictionary for components
  * Set for error codes
  * List for user activity logs
* Write explanations for why each structure is the correct choice
* Create a small Python demonstration stored in `module2_data_structures/`

### Deliverables

* `data_structures_plan.md`
* `demo_structures.py`
* Module README



# Module 3 — Troubleshooting Workflow & Flowchart

### Goal

Apply the six-step troubleshooting model to the issue:
**“SmartCycle stops syncing data to the phone.”**

### What to complete

* Write a structured troubleshooting report following the six steps
* Create a flowchart showing decision points and actions
* Store diagram:

  * As a PNG/SVG exported from a tool of your choice
  * Or as a Markdown flowchart if preferred

### Deliverables

* `troubleshooting_report.md`
* `sync_flowchart.png` (or `.md`)
* Module README



# Module 4 — Collaboration Using GitHub

### Goal

Show that you can coordinate work within a software project using GitHub tools.

### What to complete

* Branching workflow documenting who would work on what (even as a solo student, describe roles)
* Use Issues to track tasks for each module
* Use Pull Requests to simulate review and approval
* Use GitHub’s discussion/comments features to show communication
* Demonstrate meaningful commit messages and version history
* Organize your repo with clear structure and documentation

### Deliverables

* `collaboration_plan.md`
* Screenshots or links showing:

  * Issues created
  * Pull Requests
  * Comments/discussion
  * Branch merges
* Module README



# Module 5 — Intellectual Property Strategy

### Goal

Identify which components of SmartCycle should receive patent, copyright, or trademark protection.

### What to complete

* Break the system into components
* Map each component to the correct form of IP protection
* Write a one-page plan summarizing:

  * IP categories
  * Why each is appropriate
  * Risks if not protected
  * Steps you would take to secure protection

### Deliverables

* `ip_plan.md`
* Module README


# Module 6 — Data Privacy, Ethics, and Legal Considerations

### Goal

Analyze what data SmartCycle collects, identify privacy risks, propose protection strategies, and evaluate ethical/legal considerations.

### What to complete

* Identify every data type collected (location, usage stats, account info, etc.)
* Connect each type to associated privacy risks
* Build a data protection plan (permissions, minimization, storage, user rights)
* Analyze societal impact
* Reference legal principles (consent, purpose limitation, breach handling)

### Deliverables

* `privacy_ethics_plan.md`
* Module README


# Final Submission Checklist

* All module folders present and complete
* Each module’s README clearly explains intent and artifacts
* Planning documents show reasoning before implementation
* Code is clean, committed, and well-commented
* Flowcharts and diagrams are included where required
* GitHub Issues, PRs, and commit history demonstrate collaboration workflow
* Root README links to all modules clearly
